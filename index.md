features:
  - icon: 📦
    title: Model instead of store
    details: No store — no problem. State is encapsulated in the model. The model is a shallowReactive object. Destroying the model destroys the state.
  - icon: ⚡
    title: Action is an object
    details: Has its own state and behavior for execution control. Created automatically from a model method.
  - icon: 🏛️
    title: OOP
    details: Model is defined via a standard class, actions via methods. Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, destructor are available by default.
  - icon: 🏗️
    title: Model and dependency container
    details: No need to think about how to create, get, or remove a model after use — the container handles it.
  - icon: ✂️
    title: Less code
    details: Action has methods for execution control and error handling. You will write less boilerplate.
  - icon: 🧪
    title: Easy testing
    details: Less code — fewer tests.
  - icon: 🗜️

    details: Compact library with minimal bundle size.
  - icon: 🔒
